# Bakelite

Bakelite is a utility that makes it simple to communicate with your firmware.
Bakelite uses a code generator to automate the tedius process of hand building your own protocol.
It includes features like framing, error detection, and a lightweight C++ implementation suitable for small microcontrollers.


## Features
* Compact, easy to understand data serialization format
* Simple message passing
* Built in framing and error detection
* Easy to integrate with Serial, TCP, USB, I2C, etc...
* Use only the parts you need
* Code generators for:
    * C++ (header only, no STL or memory allocation)
    * Python

## How Does it Work?

## Status
This project is in early development. The C++ implementation is currently WIP.
The API and data format are not stable, and will change without notice.
